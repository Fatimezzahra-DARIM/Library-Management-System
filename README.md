# Library-Management-System
***About***  
Youcode school needs a library management system to maintain all the daily work of the library.    
**Context of the project**    
The Youcode library management application has several parts,   
I developed the Admin part which contains the following backlog:    
🔹As admin I can register and log in    
🔹As an admin I can view the dashboard which contains book statistics   
🔹as well as the display of the connected profile name (session).    
🔹As administrator I can manage (add/modify/delete) books.
